# NearBuy

An iPhone-first Expo app prototype for discovering local NYC clothing purchases through personal ranked shelves. Think Beli, but for clothes people buy nearby.

## What is built

- **Beli-style setup for shopping**: save things you want, log things you bought, and keep both in one social discovery loop.
- **Log a purchase** with photo, item name, store/link, price, and notes.
- **Want-to-buy list** for specific items or shops, similar to a shopping version of Beli's want-to-go list.
- **Convert wants into purchases** when you buy them, then rank them immediately.
- **Binary comparison ranking** after save: the app asks simple “was this better than X?” questions and inserts the item into the ranked shelf in `O(log n)` comparisons.
- **Beli-style score** from rank position; users do not manually enter a 0–10 score.
- **Feed** with friend activity such as “Sarah ranked a cropped trench coat #2.”
- **Profile shelves** with a top-10 ranked shelf, lifetime “worth it” list, and want-to-buy list.
- **Search** across your purchases, wants, friend activity, and local clothing stores, with dropdown filters for store type (vintage/thrift/boutique/consignment), cost, and minimum rating.
- **Nearby map** with a real, zoomable Leaflet map of the 5 boroughs, seeded NYC clothing stores with ratings that populate as you pan/zoom, distance sorting, optional location permission, and a shop detail page with directions, Want/Log actions, and a feed of what's been bought there.
- **Supabase persistence** with per-user row-level security and local offline fallback.

## Tech stack

- Expo + React Native + TypeScript
- React Native Web for the browser demo
- Supabase for cloud persistence and AsyncStorage for offline fallback
- Expo Image Picker and Location for native/device capabilities

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm web
```

## Supabase setup

1. Create a Supabase project and enable **Anonymous Sign-Ins** under Authentication → Providers.
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add the project URL and anon key from Project Settings → API.
4. Restart Expo after changing environment variables.

The anon key is intended for client apps. Row-level security ensures each anonymous or signed-in user can only access their own saved app state. Without environment variables, the app continues to work using AsyncStorage only.

The web demo opens through Expo. For iPhone, install Expo Go, then run:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.

## Build/export a web demo

```bash
pnpm export:web
```

This writes a static single-page web build to `dist/`.

## Useful scripts

```bash
pnpm typecheck   # TypeScript validation
pnpm web         # Run the live browser demo
pnpm ios         # Open in iOS simulator if full Xcode is installed
pnpm start       # Expo dev server / QR code
```

## Demo flow

1. Open **Log**.
2. Use **Want** mode to save something like “Cropped trench coat” from “Buffalo Exchange,” or use **Bought** mode for an item you already bought.
3. Tap **Save to wants** or **Save & rank**.
4. If ranking, answer comparison prompts until the item lands in the ranked shelf.
5. Open **Map**, tap a shop pin, then use **Want** or **Log purchase** from the shop detail page.
6. View the activity in **Feed**, ranked shelves and wants in **Shelf**, related items in **Search**, and nearby NYC clothing stores in **Map**.

## Notes

- The web map uses Leaflet + OpenStreetMap, so it's a real pannable/zoomable map with no API key required. Native (iOS via Expo Go) falls back to a simplified marker view.
- If you already created the Supabase table before wants were added, rerun `supabase/schema.sql` so the `wants` JSONB column is created.
- Store data is seeded in `src/data/seed.ts`; replacing it with live store inventory or a backend search service would be the next step.
- This repo is intentionally standalone and does not depend on Shopify infrastructure.
